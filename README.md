Square Matrix Challenge problem

Consider an alphabets square matrix that contains the english letters in random order. The given word needs to be searched in the square matrix from right to left or left to right/ top to bottom/bottom to top/diagonally towards left or right in both upwards and downwards direction and the number of matches of that word needs to be returned as output.


Eg. Consider the square matrix [C#C#K,C#S#K,C#K#K]. In this matrix, the word CSK is matched 4 times. Hence the output will be 4.

I/p format: 

1st input contains the size of string array(whether it is 2*2 matrix /3*3 matrix)
2nd input contains strings containing alphabets separated by # (like C#C#K,C#S#K,C#K#K)
3rd input contains the word to be searched (CSK)

Output:

Display number of occurrences of the given word in the square matrix
